      "CancerFree Kids is an organization dedicated to funding new treatments for pediatric cancers. Unfortunately, pediatric cancer has a long history of being grossly underfunded, which leaves children and their families with limited options or even unsafe treatments for cancer. Through funding from organizations like CancerFree Kids, pediatric cancer research can get the much funding and attention it deserves. Most importantly, children affected by cancer can get the treatment and care they need to live cancer-free.",
